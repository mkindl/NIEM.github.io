## How to search for NIEM data components


### Schema Subset Generation Tool (SSGT)

The Schema Subset Generation Tool (SSGT) is one way to search for NIEM data components.  This tool was designed to generate NIEM schema subsets, however, since the model is large, SSGT also contains a convenient search engine that can be used alone.   

In SSGT you can enter a search string and view a list of all NIEM data components that contain a lexical match to that string.  The default is to search the release for all component names, definitions, and other metadata that match the string. 

All results are displayed as a list of textual data component qualified (by namespace) names. 

The list of data component names are sorted as follows:
	All data names for which the search criteria matches a substring within the name (not including its namespace prefix),
		sorted alphabetically by namespace prefix first;
		within each namespace group names are sorted alphabetically.
	All data names for which the search criteria matches a substring within the associated data definition,
		sorted alphabetically by namespace prefix first;
		within each namespace group names are sorted alphabetically.
	
Each data name is hyperlinked to its associated metadata (type, definition,     Provides text based display of search results.
    Navigate through the properties, types, and facets and their relationships.
    Provides advanced search configuration options to refine search results.


NOTE:  The Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 browser must run in "compatibility mode" for SSGT to work correctly:
   (1)  Go to https://tools.niem.gov, and open Compatibility View (Tools / Compatibility View Settings).
   (2)  Add tools.niem.gov or niem.gov to Compatibility View, and SSGT Search will work normally.
