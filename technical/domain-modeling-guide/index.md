##### Feedback:
- x-reference some sections with [NIEM ConOps][1] to avoid duplication.
- move some sections to [NIEM ConOps][1] as a revision to that document. 
- Main thrust should be based on the implementation of the NIEM IEPD Life Cycle (LC) and conformance to the NDR and MPD specifications.

##### Response:
- ConOps never made it past version 0.5, and now contains outdated material. 
- Will not be concerned with ConOps overlaps (as long as correct/consistent).
- PMO proposed ConOps be Web pages, instead of a document.
  - ConOps has changed many times.
  - Easier to maintain pages than a document.
- If ConOps is resurrected, then agree, must balance content with ConOps. 
- Not sure why DMG should be based on implementation of the NIEM IEPD LC.
- However, domain modeling should be informed by IEPD LC; IEPD extensions should feed updates to core and domain models.
