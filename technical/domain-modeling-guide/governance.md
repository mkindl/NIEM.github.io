## Meetings, communications, accounts, registration

### Regular meetings (who, what, when, where, why)

- [__NIEM Business Architecture Committee__](https://www.niem.gov/meet-us/nbac/Pages/default.aspx) &mdash; NBAC meets (by teleconference) on the last Thursday of every month from 2:00-3:00pm.  Its primary missions are to identify the data requirements for NIEM, govern NIEM [Core], and assist the domains with the management of their models.  NBAC coordinates with NTAC, the PMO, and the domains.
- __NBAC Content Subcommittee__ &mdash; This group is a standing subcommittee under [NBAC][NBAC] that meets (by teleconference) as often as necessary to resolve issues, refactor (remodel) NIEM content, and harmonize. During a NIEM release cycle this subcommittee meets fairly regularly to prepare for the initial alpha release. Meeting times and dates are subject to change and are established by the lead developer in coordination with subcommittee members. 
- [__NIEM Technical Architecture Committee__](https://www.niem.gov/meet-us/ntac/Pages/default.aspx) &mdash; NTAC meets (by teleconference) every other week on Wednesday from 1:30-3:00pm.  Its primary missions are to identify new NIEM technical requirements, govern the NIEM architecture (the structure of the model), oversee the NIEM technical specifications and the tool strategy. NTAC coordinates with NBAC, the PMO, and the domains. 
- [__Program Management Office__](https://www.niem.gov/meet-us/Pages/pmo.aspx) &mdash; PMO holds a regular coordination meeting (via teleconference) every other Monday from 1:00-2:00pm. This meeting is generally for the PMO staff, goverance committee co-chairs, lead developer, and key representatives of the largest domains. 
- A __Joint NTAC/NBAC Face-to-Face meeting__ is generally hosted twice a year by the PMO in the Washington DC area. Exact dates vary, but meetings are generally 2-3 days in Apr/May and Oct/Nov timeframes. Dates are usually timed to coincide with key milestones in a release cycle.  These meetings are generally for all NBAC and NTAC members, all domain stewards or representatives, the lead developer, and the PMO staff. These meetings have multiple purposes, including reviewing material for a developing release, technical updates, discussion and development of new ideas, reviewing the previous year, planning the next year, coordination between NBAC and NTAC, etc.


### Email lists and resources requiring an account or registration

If you are a domain representative, an NBAC member, or an NTAC member you may need to register for one or more of the following resources in order to participate more fully in NIEM governance and its associated processes. 

- [__NTAC mailing list__](mailto:ntac@lists.gatech.edu); for NTAC members and support staff; [request to be added](mailto:ntac-request@lists.gatech.edu) &mdash; This list requires that you are a PMO-approved member of the NTAC or a member of the PMO support staff.
- [__NBAC mailing list__](mailto:nbac@lists.gatech.edu); for NBAC members and support staff; [request to be added](mailto:nbac-request@lists.gatech.edu) &mdash; This list requires that you are a PMO-approved member of the NBAC. This usually means you are affiliated with at least one (or more) NIEM domains because you are the domain steward, you represent the domain steward, or you are a domain technical representative who helps the domain steward maintain the domain model. There are also special provisions for members at-large, observers, and PMO staff. If you represent a new interested or on-boarding domain, then you can request observer status. 
- [__NIEM Configuration Control Tool (NCCT)__](https://niem.gtri.gatech.edu/ncct/); for NTAC, NBAC, and support staff; [request account](mailt :pgmw-system@gtri.gatech.edu) &mdash; Access to this tool allows governance members full participation in NIEM evolution processes. NCCT is a tool for identifying, recording, discussing, and resolving: 
  - New data requirements or changes to existing data requirements.
  - Issues, errors, bugs with/in the latest model (also earlier models).
  - Suggestions or recommendations for architectural changes.
If you are a member of the NBAC or NTAC, then you should have an NCCT account. If you are a member of the NBAC Content Subcommittee, then you absolutely must have an NCCT account to effectively participate on this subcommittee. All issues with NIEM requirements, content, and architecture related to the NIEM model are recorded, discussed, and resolved in NCCT. Resolutions are integrated into the next applicable major or minor release. Without an account you cannot read or write to NCCT.
  - Collaboration zones; for PMO, governance, and domain staffs; &mdash; At present, new Drupal-based collaboration software is currently under construction. This will be detailed here when ready. 
- [__Conformance Testing Assistant (ConTesA)__](https://tools.niem.gov/contesa/); public; [request account](https://tools.niem.gov/contesa/registration) &mdash; ConTesA is a automated validation tool that reviews schemas or IEPDs and auto-checks their validity with NIEM Naming and Design Rule (NDR). ConTesA produces a detailed validation report in HTML or spreadsheet format. Approximately half of the NDR rules are applied to a schema or IEPD. It is not possible to auto-check all of the NDR rules because some rules would require extremely advanced artificial intelligencecapabilities (that do not currently exist). However, all NDR rules are listed in the report and those checked are identified as "passed", or "failed" and why (refers to the NDR rule violated). Rules not checked by ConTesA are listed as rules that require human interpretation and response (i.e., manual pass or fail). Use of the tool does not require an account unless you want to save your reports online (otherwise, you can simply download each report generated by the tool. 
- [__NIEM GitHub__](https://niem.github.io/); public; [sign-up for GitHub account](https://github.com/) &mdash; The NIEM GitHub Website is the technical face of NIEM. It contains technical guidance, tips, open source tools, and other resources for NIEM users or developers. Use the Website simply requires a free GitHub account.
